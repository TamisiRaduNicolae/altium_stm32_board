# altium_stm32_board

  This is a board inspired by a stm32 based pcb, with usb connectivity, accelerometer module, gpio pins and swd for debug designed by phils_lab : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMEpQZ90f34.
  
  It uses STM32F4 and it also got a small power supply circuitry . 
  
  I liked very much the idea and learned some valuable concepts when designing from this tutorial and added little twists myself to the board. understood basic principles of designing for production a 4 layered pcb like how to use the differnt stackups of layers in different needs, how to work clean by keeping my schematic space tidy, and to respect general rules for traces, like space between signal traces, wider power traces for lower impedance and how to work with differential pairs (ex: for the usb_d_p and usb_d_n), and how to place efficiently decoupling capacitors :) .
